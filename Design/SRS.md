### Project SRS

1. Overview
The application will allow users to create a college portal account.  The account will allow students to gain access to the classes that they are enrolled in.
The instructors have to approve before the students can gain access.  When the students are in the access they have rights to view the course material posted by
their instructors, upload their assignments and participate in interactive discussion forms.

2. User Accounts
There will be three types of accounts: adminstrator, instructor and student.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Adminstrator
 Has access to all accounts. Have ability to grant permissions for accounts.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Instructor
