### Project SRS

1. Overview
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The application will allow users to create a college portal account.  The account will allow students to gain access to the classes that they are enrolled in.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The instructors have to approve before the students can gain access.  When the students are in the access they have rights to view the course material posted by
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; their instructors, upload their assignments and participate in interactive discussion forms.

2. User Accounts
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There will be three types of accounts: adminstrator, instructor and student.  

 2a. Adminstrator
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Has access to all accounts. Have ability to grant permissions for accounts.
